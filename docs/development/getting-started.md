## Configure ronin-cli for development
Since the ronin-cli is a command line tool, you must first unlink the production build and link the development repo.
1. Ensure that ronin-cli is uninstalled globally: 
```console
npm uninstall -g ronin-cli
```
or 
```console
yarn global remove ronin-cli
```
2. Fork the ronin-cli repo to your account. And then clone to the desired location:

#### Example: 
```console
git clone https://github.com/Squishy123/ronin-cli.git
```
#### *Replace Squishy123 with your github username

3. Navigate into the cloned directory and install project dependencies:
```console
yarn 
```
4. In the cloned directory, link ronin-cli as a system variable. Run: 
```console
yarn link
```

## Development Practices
- ### Ensure you are working off a forked repo
- ### If you are referencing an issue, make sure to create a separate branch with the following name: issueNumber_issueName 
- ### Before making a pull-request make sure you rebase against the dev branch: 
``` 
git rebase -i origin/develop
```
- ### PR's will be approved after they are reviewed and edited.
